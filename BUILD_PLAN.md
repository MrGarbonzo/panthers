# Secret Panthers - Build Plan
*Living Document - Last Updated: January 2025*

## Project Overview
Secret Panthers: NFTs that contain and control private AI agents running in TEE infrastructure.

**Core Technologies:**
- Secret Network NFTs (encrypted metadata)
- Secret VM (GPU-enabled TEE)
- Secret AI SDK (private LLM calls)

**Vision:** Each NFT contains configuration for a unique AI agent that only the owner can deploy and use.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2) - CURRENT PHASE
**Goal:** Get core pieces talking to each other

### IMPORTANT NOTE
**NFT Contract and Minting are handled by another team**
We are responsible for everything AFTER the NFT exists:
- Agent implementation
- Deployment orchestration
- Frontend dashboard
- Authentication flow

### 1.1 Development Environment Setup âœ…

#### Task List:
- [x] Create Secret Network testnet wallet âœ…
  - [x] Install Keplr wallet
  - [x] Get testnet SCRT from faucet
  - [x] Document wallet address
  
- [x] Configure Secret VM Access âœ…
  - [x] Contact Secret team for access credentials
  - [x] Get GPU TEE allocation
  - [x] Document endpoints and keys
  - [x] Test basic deployment capability
  
- [ ] Set up IPFS Storage
  - [ ] Create Pinata account (easier than own node)
  - [ ] Get API keys
  - [ ] Test pin/unpin functionality
  - [ ] Document CID storage strategy
  
- [ ] Repository Structure
  - [ ] Create GitHub repo: `secret-panthers`
  - [ ] Set up monorepo structure:
    ```
    /contracts     - CosmWasm NFT contract
    /agent        - Python agent container
    /orchestrator - Deployment management
    /frontend     - Next.js app
    /docs         - Documentation
    ```
  - [ ] Add .gitignore for secrets
  - [ ] Create README.md

### 1.2 NFT Contract Interface âœ… (PROVIDED BY OTHERS)

#### What We Need From NFT Contract:
- Query ownership: `ownerOf(tokenId) â†’ address`
- Get metadata: `getMetadata(tokenId) â†’ encrypted data`
- Monitor transfer events

#### Expected Metadata Structure:
```
EncryptedMetadata {
  agent_config: {
    model: "deepseek-chat",
    system_prompt: "You are a helpful panther...",
    temperature: 0.7,
    max_tokens: 2000,
    capabilities: ["chat", "code"]
  },
  deployment: {
    image: "secretpanthers/agent:latest",
    resources: {
      cpu: "2",
      memory: "4Gi", 
      gpu: true
    }
  }
}
```

#### Integration Points:
- [ ] Document NFT contract address
- [ ] Test query functions
- [ ] Verify metadata format
- [ ] Set up event monitoring

## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions:
- Using Pinata for IPFS (simpler than running own node)
- Python for agent (good AI library support)
- FastAPI for agent API (async support)
- Next.js for frontend (good Web3 integration)

### Open Questions:
1. How much GPU memory per Secret VM instance?
2. Rate limits on Secret AI SDK?
3. Cost per deployment on Secret VM?
4. Maximum metadata size for NFT?

## ACCELERATED TIMELINE (Secret VM Ready + Shared Agent Model)

Since Secret VM is already configured and we're using a shared agent model with unique traits:

### Revised Architecture - ONE Agent, MANY Personalities

#### What Changed:
- **OLD**: Deploy separate agent for each NFT (too expensive)
- **NEW**: One shared agent that loads unique traits per NFT
- **BENEFIT**: $1,000/month instead of $20,000/month for 100 NFTs

### Week 1 Goals - Shared Agent with Traits

#### Priority Order:
1. **Shared Agent Service** (Days 1-2)
   - Python/FastAPI with Secret AI SDK
   - Session management per NFT
   - Deploy ONE instance to Secret VM

2. **Trait System** (Days 2-3)
   - Load traits from NFT metadata
   - Generate dynamic system prompts
   - Apply personality to responses

3. **Integration** (Days 4-5)
   - NFT ownership verification
   - Trait-based chat sessions
   - End-to-end test

### What We Can Skip:
- âœ… Secret VM setup tutorials
- âœ… TEE verification learning
- âœ… Deployment debugging
- âœ… GPU access testing

### What to Focus On NOW:
1. **Get the NFT contract working** - This is the foundation
2. **Build the agent container** - Simple version first
3. **Connect them in Secret VM** - You already know how to deploy
