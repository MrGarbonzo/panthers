# Quick Start Guide - What to Build First

Since you already have Secret VM working, here's the optimal build order:

## Day 1: NFT Contract (Morning)

### Step 1: Initialize CosmWasm Contract
```bash
cd contracts
cargo generate --git https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template.git --name secret-panthers
cd secret-panthers
```

### Step 2: Core NFT Structure
Focus on:
1. Basic minting function
2. Encrypted metadata storage
3. Ownership queries

Don't worry about:
- Complex features
- Perfect optimization
- UI

## Day 1: Agent Container (Afternoon)

### Step 1: Create Simple Agent
```bash
cd agent
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install fastapi uvicorn secret-ai-sdk httpx
```

### Step 2: Minimal Working Agent
Just need:
1. Health check endpoint
2. Basic chat endpoint using Secret AI
3. Dockerfile

## Day 2: Connect Everything

### Morning: Deploy NFT to Testnet
1. Deploy contract
2. Mint test NFT
3. Verify metadata storage

### Afternoon: Deploy Agent to Secret VM
1. Build container
2. Push to registry
3. Deploy to Secret VM (you know how!)
4. Test chat endpoint

## Day 3: Integration

Connect agent to NFT:
1. Agent reads NFT ID from environment
2. Queries contract for metadata
3. Uses metadata for configuration

## Success Metric

By end of Day 3, you should be able to:
1. Mint an NFT with metadata
2. Deploy agent to Secret VM
3. Agent reads its config from NFT
4. Chat with the agent

Everything else is polish!

## Immediate Next Action

Choose one:
A) Start with NFT contract (if you prefer Rust)
B) Start with Python agent (if you prefer Python)
C) Create both skeletons first, then implement

What's your preference?
