## Trait Generation Method

### Deterministic Generation
Traits are generated deterministically from the NFT token ID using a secret salt, ensuring:
- Consistent traits for each NFT
- No two NFTs have identical combinations
- Traits can't be predicted without the salt
- Fair distribution across all options

### Generation Process
1. Hash(token_id + secret_salt) = trait_seed
2. Use trait_seed to select from each category
3. Store in NFT encrypted metadata at mint
4. Traits are permanent and immutable

## Rarity Distribution

### Trait Rarity
Not all combinations are equally common:

**Common (60% of NFTs)**
- Standard personality + common style
- 2 expertise areas
- Moderate modifiers

**Uncommon (30% of NFTs)**
- Interesting personality combinations
- 2-3 expertise areas
- Some extreme modifiers

**Rare (9% of NFTs)**
- Unique personality combos
- 3 expertise areas
- Multiple extreme modifiers

**Legendary (1% of NFTs)**
- Perfect synergy combinations
- 3-4 expertise areas
- Unique hidden abilities
- Easter egg responses
